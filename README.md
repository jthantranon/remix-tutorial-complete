# remix-tutorial-complete
the short tutorial on remix, completed, but converted to mostly jsx instead of tsx and has an extra demo at /movies that pulls from a mongo database (using the example data from mflix) with the mongo adapter living under app/db.mongo-server.js next to the SQLite adapter db.server.js instead of replacing it.
